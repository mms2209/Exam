# Quick Start Guide - AI Exam Tutor

## What You Need to Know

Your AI exam tutor system is ready! Here's what's been built:

1. **Database tables** for storing exam papers, subjects, and chat sessions
2. **PDF text extraction** that reads exam papers and marking schemes
3. **Smart AI chat** that detects question numbers and provides focused answers
4. **Complete storage setup** for file uploads

## 3-Step Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Database Tables

1. Open [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy/paste contents of `supabase/migrations/20251001130000_create_exam_papers_system.sql`
4. Click "Run"

**Result**: Creates exam_subjects, exam_papers, student_paper_interactions, and chat_sessions tables

### Step 2: Create Storage Buckets

1. In Supabase Dashboard, go to Storage
2. Create bucket: `exam-papers` (Private, 10MB limit)
3. Create bucket: `marking-schemes` (Private, 10MB limit)
4. Follow detailed policies in `STORAGE_SETUP.md`

**Result**: Students and admins can upload/download PDF files

### Step 3: Test It

1. Log in as admin (admin@example.com)
2. Go to Admin ‚Üí Exam Papers
3. Upload a sample exam paper + marking scheme
4. Wait for extraction (watch status badge)
5. Log in as student (member role)
6. Go to Exam Papers ‚Üí Open the paper
7. Ask: "Explain question 1"
8. Watch the AI provide focused, detailed answer!

## How Students Use It

Students simply ask natural questions:

```
"Explain question 1"
"How do I solve Q5?"
"What's question 3 asking?"
"Show me the solution for question 2a"
"What are the marking points for question 4?"
```

The AI will:
1. ‚úÖ Quote the exact question from the exam paper
2. ‚úÖ Explain what it's asking in simple terms
3. ‚úÖ Give 2-3 practical examples
4. ‚úÖ List specific marking points from the scheme
5. ‚úÖ Provide a complete model answer

## What Makes This Special

### Before (Not Working)
- ‚ùå No database tables for exam papers
- ‚ùå AI received no exam paper content
- ‚ùå AI gave generic, unhelpful answers
- ‚ùå No marking scheme integration

### After (Now Working)
- ‚úÖ Complete database schema with RLS
- ‚úÖ PDF text automatically extracted
- ‚úÖ AI receives actual question + marking scheme
- ‚úÖ AI quotes exam paper and references scheme
- ‚úÖ Focused, accurate, helpful responses

## Example Interaction

**Student asks**: "Explain question 5"

**System does**:
1. Detects question number: 5
2. Extracts Q5 text from exam paper
3. Extracts Q5 marking scheme
4. Sends focused content to AI

**AI responds**:
```
