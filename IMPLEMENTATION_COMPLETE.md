# Exam Paper AI Tutor System - Implementation Complete

## What Has Been Implemented

The complete AI-powered exam paper tutor system has been successfully implemented. Here's what's now available:

### 1. Database Schema (NEW)

Created comprehensive database tables in migration `20251001130000_create_exam_papers_system.sql`:

**exam_subjects table**
- Stores subject information (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Islamic Finance)
- Pre-populated with 5 default subjects

**exam_papers table**
- Stores exam paper metadata and file locations
- Includes columns for extracted text from PDFs
- Tracks extraction status (pending, processing, completed, failed)
- Foreign keys to subjects and users

**student_paper_interactions table**
- Tracks which students access which papers
- Records access count and last access time

**chat_sessions table**
- Stores AI chat history for each student per paper
- Uses JSONB for flexible message storage

### 2. Storage Buckets

Two storage buckets are required (setup instructions in `STORAGE_SETUP.md`):
- `exam-papers`: Stores uploaded exam paper PDFs
- `marking-schemes`: Stores marking scheme PDFs

### 3. Enhanced AI Chat Function

Upgraded `supabase/functions/exam-chat-ai/index.ts` with:

**Question Number Detection**
- Automatically detects when students ask about specific questions
- Recognizes formats: "question 1", "Q5", "q3", "1)", "5a", etc.

**Smart Content Extraction**
- Extracts the specific question text from the exam paper
- Extracts the corresponding marking scheme section
- Sends only relevant content to AI instead of entire document

**Enhanced AI Prompts**
- Instructs AI to quote the exact question text
- Directs AI to reference marking scheme explicitly
- Requests structured responses with:
  - Explanation (with question breakdown)
  - Examples (2-3 concrete examples)
  - How to Get Full Marks (marking points from scheme)
  - Solution (complete model answer)

**Helper Functions Added**
- `extractQuestionNumber()`: Detects question numbers from user queries
- `extractSpecificQuestion()`: Extracts question text from exam paper
- `extractSpecificMarkingScheme()`: Extracts marking scheme for question

### 4. Row Level Security (RLS)

All tables have comprehensive RLS policies:
- Exam subjects: Readable by all authenticated users, manageable by admins
- Exam papers: Viewable with `exam_papers.view` permission, manageable with `exam_papers.manage` permission
- Student interactions: Users can only access their own records
- Chat sessions: Users can only access their own sessions

### 5. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:
- `STORAGE_SETUP.md`: Step-by-step storage bucket setup
- Updated `README.md` with:
  - Complete setup instructions
  - Database migration order
  - How the AI tutor works
  - Question detection capabilities
  - Upload and interaction flow

## How It Works

### For Admins (Upload Flow)

1. Admin logs in and navigates to Admin → Exam Papers
2. Clicks "Upload Paper" button
3. Fills in metadata:
   - Subject (from dropdown)
   - Year
   - Paper number (e.g., "1", "2A")
   - Optional title
4. Uploads exam paper PDF
5. Uploads marking scheme PDF
6. System stores files in Supabase storage
7. `extract-pdf-text` edge function is triggered automatically
8. PDF text is extracted and stored in database
9. Admin sees extraction status: pending → processing → completed

### For Students (Chat Flow)

1. Student logs in and navigates to Exam Papers
2. Browses available papers by subject/year
3. Opens a specific paper
4. Views PDF on left side, AI chat on right side
5. Asks question in natural language:
   - "Explain question 1"
   - "How do I solve Q5?"
   - "What's the marking scheme for question 3?"
6. System detects question number (if present)
7. Extracts specific question from exam paper text
8. Extracts corresponding marking scheme section
9. Sends focused content to AI
10. AI generates structured response with:
    - Exact question text quoted
    - Clear explanation of concepts
    - Practical examples
    - Marking points from scheme
    - Complete model answer
11. Student receives comprehensive guidance

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Apply Database Migration

Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor and run:
```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire contents of:
-- supabase/migrations/20251001130000_create_exam_papers_system.sql
```

This creates:
- exam_subjects table (with 5 default subjects)
- exam_papers table
- student_paper_interactions table
- chat_sessions table
- All necessary indexes
- All RLS policies

### 2. Create Storage Buckets

Follow instructions in `STORAGE_SETUP.md`:

1. Create `exam-papers` bucket (Private, 10MB, PDF only)
2. Create `marking-schemes` bucket (Private, 10MB, PDF only)
3. Apply storage policies for both buckets

### 3. Verify Setup

Check that:
- ✅ All tables exist (exam_subjects, exam_papers, student_paper_interactions, chat_sessions)
- ✅ RLS is enabled on all tables
- ✅ Both storage buckets exist
- ✅ Storage policies are applied
- ✅ Gemini API key is configured in Edge Function secrets

### 4. Test the System

1. Log in as admin user (admin@example.com)
2. Navigate to Admin → Exam Papers
3. Upload a test exam paper with marking scheme
4. Wait for extraction to complete (check status badge)
5. Log in as a student (member role)
6. Navigate to Exam Papers
7. Open the uploaded paper
8. Ask: "Explain question 1"
9. Verify AI responds with structured answer referencing the paper

## Key Features

### Intelligent Question Detection

The system recognizes various question formats:
```
"question 1" → Detects Q1
"Q5a" → Detects Q5a
"explain q3" → Detects Q3
"how to solve 2)" → Detects Q2
"5. solution" → Detects Q5
```

### Focused Content Delivery

Instead of sending the entire 20-page exam paper to the AI:
- System extracts just the specific question (e.g., Q5)
- Extracts just the marking scheme for Q5
- AI receives focused, relevant content
- Results in more accurate, specific responses

### Marking Scheme Integration

The AI is instructed to:
- Quote specific marking points from the scheme
- Show marks allocated for each point (if present)
- Provide guidance aligned with examiner expectations
- Help students understand what earns marks

### Structured Responses

Every AI response follows a consistent format:
1. **Explanation**: What the question asks, key concepts
2. **Examples**: 2-3 concrete, practical examples
3. **How to Get Full Marks**: Specific marking points
4. **Solution**: Complete model answer

## Technical Details

### PDF Text Extraction

- Uses `pdf-parse` library in Deno
- Extracts text from both exam paper and marking scheme
- Stores extracted text in database columns
- Updates extraction status for tracking
- Handles errors gracefully (displays error message)

### Question Parsing Logic

Multiple regex patterns detect question numbers:
- `question\s+(\d+[a-z]?)` → "question 1", "question 5a"
- `q\.?\s*(\d+[a-z]?)` → "Q1", "Q.5", "q3"
- `\b(\d+[a-z]?)\s*\)` → "1)", "5a)"
- Line-by-line parsing for complex layouts

### Content Extraction Algorithm

1. Detect question number from user query
2. Search exam paper text for question start
3. Capture text until next question number found
4. Stop after reasonable length (50 lines)
5. Repeat process for marking scheme (100 lines max)
6. Validate extracted content length
7. Return null if extraction fails (fallback to full content)

### AI Prompt Engineering

The prompt explicitly:
- Tells AI it has specific question + marking scheme
- Requests quoting of exact question text
- Demands reference to marking scheme points
- Specifies structured response format
- Emphasizes educational, helpful tone

## Troubleshooting

### PDF Extraction Fails

**Symptom**: Status shows "failed" in admin panel
**Causes**:
- PDF is scanned image (no text layer)
- PDF is corrupted
- PDF is password-protected

**Solution**:
- Ensure PDFs have text layer (not just images)
- Use "Retry extraction" button in admin panel
- Check Edge Function logs for specific error

### AI Doesn't Reference Paper Content

**Symptom**: AI gives generic answers, doesn't quote exam paper
**Causes**:
- PDF extraction still in progress
- Extraction failed (check status)
- PDF text is garbled or encoded

**Solution**:
- Wait for extraction to complete (check status badge)
- If failed, retry extraction
- Verify extracted text quality in database

### Question Not Detected

**Symptom**: AI responds to full paper instead of specific question
**Causes**:
- Question number format not recognized
- User didn't specify question number

**Solution**:
- Ask in clearer format: "Explain question 5"
- Check Edge Function logs to see what was detected
- System falls back gracefully to full paper content

## Next Steps

1. Apply the database migration
2. Create storage buckets with policies
3. Upload test exam papers
4. Test the AI chat with specific questions
5. Monitor extraction status for papers
6. Gather user feedback on AI responses
7. Fine-tune prompts if needed

## Security Notes

- All tables have RLS enabled
- Students can only view papers they have permission for
- Storage buckets are private (authenticated access only)
- Admins need `exam_papers.manage` permission to upload
- Chat sessions are isolated per user
- Marking schemes are not directly visible to students (only used by AI)

## Performance Considerations

- Indexes on frequently queried columns (subject_id, year, status)
- JSONB for flexible chat message storage
- Text extraction runs asynchronously (doesn't block upload)
- Question extraction runs in-memory (no database queries)
- AI responses cached in chat_sessions table

## Success Criteria

The system is working correctly when:
- ✅ Admin can upload exam papers successfully
- ✅ PDF text extraction completes without errors
- ✅ Students can view uploaded papers
- ✅ AI chat interface loads properly
- ✅ Student asks "Explain question 1"
- ✅ AI quotes the actual question from the paper
- ✅ AI references marking scheme points
- ✅ AI provides structured response (Explanation, Examples, How to Get Full Marks, Solution)
- ✅ Chat history persists across sessions

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check Edge Function logs in Supabase Dashboard
2. Verify database tables and RLS policies
3. Confirm storage buckets exist with correct policies
4. Test PDF text extraction manually
5. Review browser console for frontend errors
