# Mathematics Display and Marking Scheme Fixes

## Issues Identified

You reported two critical problems with the AI tutor for mathematics:

1. **AI responses don't match the marking scheme** - The AI was giving general answers instead of strictly following the marking criteria
2. **Mathematical formulas display incorrectly** - Formulas appear distorted/garbled in the chat interface

## Root Causes

### Issue 1: Marking Scheme Not Followed Strictly

**Problem**: The AI prompt was too generic and didn't emphasize the importance of strictly following the marking scheme. It would provide its own interpretation rather than addressing every marking point.

**Why this happened**:
- The prompt said "use the marking scheme" but didn't mandate strict adherence
- No instruction to quote marking points exactly
- No requirement to address EVERY marking point
- No guidance on showing marks allocated

### Issue 2: Mathematical Formulas Garbled

**Problem**: Mathematical notation gets corrupted during PDF extraction and rendering.

**Why this happens**:
1. **PDF extraction**: PDFs use special encoding for mathematical symbols. When extracted as plain text, symbols like √, ∫, π, ², ³ get converted to weird characters or Unicode that doesn't render properly
2. **Display rendering**: The UI was using `<p>` tags which collapse whitespace and don't preserve formatting
3. **No LaTeX support**: The interface doesn't support proper mathematical typesetting

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Enhanced AI Prompt for Strict Marking Scheme Adherence

**File Modified**: `supabase/functions/exam-chat-ai/index.ts`

**Changes Made**:

1. **Added CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS section** (lines 124-129):
```typescript
CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR MATHEMATICAL CONTENT:
- When writing mathematical expressions, use plain text notation that is clear and unambiguous
- Use standard notation: x^2 for x squared, sqrt(x) for square root, integral signs, fractions as a/b
- Use spacing and line breaks to make formulas readable
- Show step-by-step working with clear explanations at each step
- Preserve mathematical notation exactly as it appears in the exam paper and marking scheme
```

2. **Strengthened marking scheme instructions** (lines 133-144):
```typescript
YOU MUST STRICTLY FOLLOW THE MARKING SCHEME:
1. Identify EVERY marking point mentioned in the scheme
2. Your solution MUST address EVERY SINGLE marking point - do not skip any
3. Quote the marking points EXACTLY as they appear in the scheme
4. Show the marks allocated for each point (e.g., "[2 marks]")
5. Structure your solution to match the marking scheme structure
6. If the marking scheme shows specific steps or formulas, include those EXACT steps
7. Your solution should earn FULL MARKS based on the marking scheme provided
```

3. **Added mandatory requirements** (lines 157-165):
```typescript
YOU MUST INCLUDE:
- Every marking point from the scheme (quote exactly)
- Marks allocated for each point (if shown)
- Important terminology to use
- Required formulas or methods
- Common mistakes to avoid
- How to structure the answer to match marking expectations

DO NOT add your own marking criteria - use ONLY what is in the provided marking scheme.
```

4. **Enhanced solution requirements** (lines 168-175):
```typescript
CRITICAL: Your solution MUST address EVERY marking point from the scheme in the exact order shown.
After each step, indicate which marking point(s) you are addressing and the marks earned.

For mathematical solutions:
- Number each step clearly (Step 1, Step 2, etc.)
- Show all working - never skip steps
- State formulas before using them
- Include units where applicable
- Box or highlight final answers
```

### Fix 2: Improved Mathematical Formula Display

**File Modified**: `src/pages/ExamPaperViewer.tsx`

**Changes Made**:

Changed display from plain `<p>` tags to monospace formatted `<div>` with preserved whitespace:

**Before**:
```typescript
<p className="text-gray-700">{aiResponse.explanation}</p>
<p className="text-gray-700 whitespace-pre-wrap">{aiResponse.solution}</p>
```

**After**:
```typescript
<div className="text-gray-700 whitespace-pre-wrap font-mono text-xs leading-relaxed">
  {aiResponse.explanation}
</div>
<div className="text-gray-700 whitespace-pre-wrap font-mono text-xs leading-relaxed">
  {aiResponse.solution}
</div>
```

**Benefits**:
- `font-mono`: Uses monospace font which displays mathematical notation more clearly
- `whitespace-pre-wrap`: Preserves spaces, line breaks, and formatting
- `leading-relaxed`: Adds more line spacing for better readability
- `text-xs`: Smaller font size allows more complex expressions to fit

## How It Works Now

### For Mathematical Content

**When a student asks**: "Explain question 5"

**System extracts from PDF**:
```
Question 5: Find the derivative of f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1
```

**AI receives this plus marking scheme**:
```
Marking Scheme Question 5:
- Correct use of power rule [2 marks]
- Derivative of 3x^2 is 6x [1 mark]
- Derivative of 2x is 2 [1 mark]
- Derivative of constant is 0 [1 mark]
- Final answer f'(x) = 6x + 2 [1 mark]
Total: 6 marks
```

**AI now responds**:

## Explanation
Question 5 asks: "Find the derivative of f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 1"

This requires using the power rule: d/dx(x^n) = n*x^(n-1)

## How to Get Full Marks
Based on the marking scheme, you must include:
- Correct use of power rule [2 marks]
- Derivative of 3x^2 is 6x [1 mark]
- Derivative of 2x is 2 [1 mark]
- Derivative of constant is 0 [1 mark]
- Final answer f'(x) = 6x + 2 [1 mark]

Total available: 6 marks

## Solution
Step 1: Apply the power rule to each term
For 3x^2: Using d/dx(x^n) = n*x^(n-1)
d/dx(3x^2) = 3 * 2 * x^(2-1) = 6x [1 mark for correct application]

Step 2: Differentiate the linear term
d/dx(2x) = 2 [1 mark]

Step 3: Differentiate the constant
d/dx(1) = 0 [1 mark]

Step 4: Combine all terms
f'(x) = 6x + 2 + 0
f'(x) = 6x + 2 [1 mark for final answer]

**Total marks earned: 6/6** ✓

### Key Improvements

1. **Every marking point is addressed** - Nothing is skipped
2. **Marks are shown explicitly** - Student knows exactly what earns marks
3. **Steps match marking scheme** - Solution follows the exact structure expected
4. **Mathematical notation is clear** - Uses x^2, sqrt(), etc. instead of garbled Unicode
5. **Working is shown** - Every step is explained
6. **Formatting is preserved** - Spacing and line breaks make it readable

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Deploy Updated Edge Function

The `exam-chat-ai` function has been significantly enhanced:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions
2. Click on `exam-chat-ai`
3. Click "Deploy new version"
4. Copy/paste the entire contents of `supabase/functions/exam-chat-ai/index.ts`
5. Click "Deploy"

### Step 2: Frontend Updates (Automatic)

The frontend changes are already in your codebase. Next build/deploy will include them.

### Step 3: Test With Mathematics Paper

1. Upload a mathematics exam paper with marking scheme
2. Wait for extraction to complete
3. Open the paper and ask: "Explain question 1"
4. Verify the AI:
   - Quotes exact marking points from scheme
   - Shows marks allocated
   - Addresses every marking criterion
   - Uses clear mathematical notation (x^2, sqrt(x), etc.)
   - Numbers steps clearly
   - Shows all working

## Tips for Better Mathematical Display

### For Students Asking Questions

**Good question formats**:
- "Explain question 5" (detects Q5, extracts it + marking scheme)
- "How to solve question 3" (same)
- "Show me the working for Q2" (same)

### For Admins Uploading Papers

**Ensure good PDF quality**:
- PDFs should have text layer (not scanned images)
- Use PDFs created from Word/LaTeX, not photographed papers
- Test by opening PDF in a text editor - if you see readable text, it will extract well

### Understanding Extraction Limitations

**What works well**:
- Typed mathematical expressions using standard symbols
- Formulas written with keyboard characters
- Text-based PDFs with Unicode math symbols

**What may have issues**:
- Complex LaTeX equations rendered as images
- Handwritten mathematical notation
- Scanned papers without OCR
- Specialized mathematical symbols not in standard Unicode

**Workaround for problematic PDFs**:
The AI is instructed to use clear plain-text notation:
- Instead of: ∫₀¹ x² dx (which may get garbled)
- AI writes: integral from 0 to 1 of x^2 dx (always readable)

## Verification Checklist

After deploying the updated edge function:

- ✅ AI quotes exact marking points from scheme
- ✅ AI shows marks allocated (e.g., "[2 marks]")
- ✅ AI addresses EVERY marking criterion
- ✅ Solution matches marking scheme structure
- ✅ Mathematical notation is readable (x^2, sqrt(), etc.)
- ✅ Steps are numbered and clear
- ✅ All working is shown
- ✅ Formatting is preserved in chat display

## Troubleshooting

### AI still not following marking scheme

**Check**:
1. Edge function deployed with latest code?
2. Marking scheme was extracted from PDF? (Check database)
3. Marking scheme has clear marking points?

**Solution**:
- Verify extraction status shows "completed"
- Check database: marking_scheme_extracted_text should have content
- If marking scheme text is empty, PDF may need manual review

### Mathematical formulas still garbled

**Check**:
1. Frontend code updated with new display styling?
2. Using monospace font (font-mono class)?
3. Preserving whitespace (whitespace-pre-wrap)?

**Solution**:
- Rebuild frontend: `npm run build`
- Check browser console for any React errors
- Try clearing browser cache

### AI not showing marks for each step

**Check**:
1. Marking scheme actually has marks allocated?
2. AI received the marking scheme in the prompt?

**Solution**:
- Check Edge Function logs to see what AI received
- Verify marking scheme extraction contains mark allocations
- If scheme doesn't show marks, AI will still structure answer correctly

## Advanced: Future Improvements

For even better mathematical display, consider:

1. **KaTeX/MathJax Integration**:
   - Add LaTeX rendering library
   - Convert plain text math to rendered formulas
   - Would require AI to output LaTeX notation

2. **Custom Markdown Parser**:
   - Parse math expressions and render specially
   - Handle fractions, exponents, roots visually

3. **Image-Based Math Recognition**:
   - Use OCR for handwritten papers
   - Extract math from image-based PDFs
   - More complex but handles any notation

For now, the plain-text with monospace font approach provides clear, readable mathematical content without external dependencies.

## Success Criteria
